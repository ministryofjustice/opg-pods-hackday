    <p class="govuk-body">A GOV.UK wallet lets you keep your important government documents in one place, no matter where you go.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can securely access and share important documents like your driving licence, lasting power of attorney (LPA), and national insurance card.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If any of your documents change, they can be updated in your wallet.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can access your wallet online or from the GOV.UK app on your phone.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why add an LPA to your GOV.UK wallet?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Whenever you want to make a decision on Alexâ€™s behalf, organisations will need to see the LPA.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you add an LPA to your wallet, you can quickly and securely grant organisations access to the LPA.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can decide whether to give organisations one-off, temporary access to the LPA, or ongoing access which allows them to view the LPA whenever they need to.</p>
